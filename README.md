# Weight Tracker

## Overview

The **Weight Tracker** is a web application that helps users track their weight over time. It allows users to:

- Add new weight entries.
- Edit and delete existing entries.
- View weight history and generate reports on their progress.

The application is built using **Microservices Architecture**, with two main microservices:

1. **Tracker Microservice** - Handles user weight data (add, edit, delete).
2. **Report Microservice** - Generates and provides reports on the user's weight progress over time.
